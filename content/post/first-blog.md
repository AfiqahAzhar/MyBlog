### Get to grips quickly with The Sims 4


The Sims 4 is one of the best selling game of all times as it offers gamers the ultimate life-simulation experience.

Since the game was launched, we've had its first ever expansion pack called [`The Sims 4: Get to Work`](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/pc/store/mac-pc-download-addon-the-sims-4-get-to-work) and two stuff packs themed around the "Luxury Party" and creating the "Perfect Patio".

To me personally, I am very obsessed with this game because we can create our own characters which is awesome.

Creating your Sims is arguably the most important element of the game, as a player are responsible for deciding everything down to their physical appearance, their outfits and personality traits.
