### Top 3 My Favourite Sims 4 Expansion Packs


It is really tough to choose which expansion is the best, all of them offer new furnitures, new clothes, new aspirations and new skills. Not only they offer expnsion packs but stuff and game packs too. But thats for later story.

We wouldn't recommend skipping out on any, but we will recommend you buy these first. They offer more bang for your buck in experiences.


##### Number 3: The Sims 4: Get to Work

This expansion pack lets your characters leave their home and do some real hands-on work. 
The Sims 4 career options for this pack:

1. Doctor
2. Detective
3. Scientist (_My most favourite_)

In Scientist Career, it is an alien exclusive and you can unlock a new secret hidden lot which is the **The Sixam**

##### Number 2: The Sims 4: Get Famous

One reason why it is at number 2 of my must buy expansion list is because this pack offers many things such as become famous, acting career, have fans (_with perks_) and be an influencer.

 When you become famous, you do not have to pay for anything again. Basically, this is by far the most fun Expansion Pack for Sims 4.

##### Number 1: The Sims 4: City Living

The city of San Myshuno is broken down into four main districts. It is lively and offers a real city living experience like playing basketball on a court, participating in a pickup game, flea markets, and festivals. 


There are rooftop bars and some amazing apartments if you can snag one. Plus, this expansion comes with some awesome cultural food options and clothing. If you are looking to see what the creators of The Sims can do with a little culture this is the best expansion pack for it.
