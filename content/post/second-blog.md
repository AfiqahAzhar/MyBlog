##### How to Play Like a Pro in PUBG


PUBG is at its core a battle royale game, meaning you and up to three teammates will be duking it out on a massive map with 99 other players, all in hopes of getting that chicken dinner - first place.


**How to Survive in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds**


Survival is key to winning in PUBG, from start to finish. Your goal is to stay alive for as long as possible, and your playstyle should mirror that fact. 

It can be tempting to run towards distant gunshots or engage in a long-range sniper war, but nine times out of ten it’s not going to be worth it unless you are sure you can get the kill and come out alive. 


Therefore, your goal is not to get the most kills possible, your goal is to stay alive for as long as possible at whatever cost.


**Getting the Best Gear**


The next step is getting loot, as you’ll be completely helpless and defenseless without it. Looting may seem simple, but in PUBG your looting speed can make the difference between a win and a loss. 

The best looting strategy doesn’t use the interact button at all, as when you loot a hotspot you’ll be trying to take as much of it as possible in the shortest amount of time.


**The Healers**

After taking damage in PUBG, your health bar will need to be filled up with some healing. There are three different healing items, and the first two only take you up to 75% of your health bar.


- **The Bandage**: 4 second cast time, heals 10 health over 4 seconds.
- **The First Aid Kit**: 6 second cast time, always heals to 75%.
- **The Med Kit**: 8 second cast time, heals to 100%.
